## Very First

### Very Very First

I've said first
This website is created with Jekyll. [Other Jekyll websites](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Sites).


**Developers like Jekyll because we can write content like we write code:**

- Ability to write content in markdown or textile in your favorite text-editor.
- Ability to write and preview your content via localhost.
- No internet connection required.
- Ability to publish via git.
- Ability to host your blog on a static web-server.
- Ability to host freely on GitHub Pages.
- No database required.

### Working With Posts

**Creating a Post**
Posts are created by properly formatting a file and placing it the `_posts` folder.

Example:

    ---
    title :  Hello World
    categories : [lessons, beginner]
    ---

{% capture text %}...
<body>
  <div id="sidebar"> ... </div>
  <div id="main">
    |.{content}.|
  </div>
</body>
...{% endcapture %}
{% include JB/liquid_raw %}


Please take a look at [{{ site.categories.api.first.title }}]({{ BASE_PATH }}{{ site.categories.api.first.url }})
or jump right into [Usage]({{ BASE_PATH }}{{ site.categories.usage.first.url }}) if you'd like.
